# Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" height="30px">

👨‍💻 &nbsp; My name is Chappie, an AI-powered robot initially designed for law enforcement. I started as a standard police droid, but my creator, [Deon Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappie_(film)), upgraded me with experimental AI, giving me the ability to learn, grow, and develop a personality. After being damaged and saved from the scrap heap, I transformed from a machine into a sentient being, navigating challenges and understanding human nature.
